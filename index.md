# You and your Kitsu Anime library

This tutorial guides you through to the core elements of how you can access your [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io) Anime library.
We will have a look at the different elements of the [Kitsu API](http://docs.kitsu.apiary.io) and how they can provide you with the data needed to build your application.

We focus on three elements
- [users](http://docs.kitsu.apiary.io/#reference/users),
- [libraries](http://docs.kitsu.apiary.io/#reference/user-libraries), and
- [Anime series](http://docs.kitsu.apiary.io/#reference/media/anime).
